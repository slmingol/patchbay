Sources identify the same box inconsistently — shortname vs FQDN, hostname vs
chassis serial, per-source duplicates. After every poll this pass:

1. canonicalizes device names (domain stripped, lowercased) and merges
   duplicate records, coalescing fields by source priority;
2. rewrites link endpoints that match a device's serial to its name;
3. fuses half-links (two rows for one device pair, each knowing only its
   own port) into a single row with both ports.

Merges are recorded in `aliases` so old names still resolve in the UI.
